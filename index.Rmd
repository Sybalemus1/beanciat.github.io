[CIAT's](https://ciat.cgiar.org/) research shows a long and successful trajectory in the development of varieties with genetic resistance to the main pests and diseases that affect the crop. Currently, the Center's scientists emphasize the development of high performance lines with tolerance to drought, heat, adverse soil conditions such as low phosphorus availability and compaction, as well as promising lines for high symbiotic nitrogen fixation, in harmony with the demand for commercial grain.
